# Vaibhav's Wiki

Hi..! Welcome to Vaibhav's personal Wiki. Built with Material for MkDocs served with GitHub Actions.

I am passionate **Data Engineer** having more than a decade of experience in building modern, scalable and durable data solutions on distributed systems.

My Blog - Some of the very basic how to guides as I learn through

Notes - Reference docs I prepared for personal learning.

## My Work

You can see my recent work around data analytics by visiting following links:

- Data Analytics on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iyadavvaibhav)
- Data Visualization on [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/profile/iyadavvaibhav)


### Kaggle

Amazing place for data science enthusiasts. If you are learning data science you can find kernels and data sets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). Some of my work are:

- [VY Notebook](https://iyadavvaibhav.github.io/vybook/) - Data Science Notes
- [Linear Regression in Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/iyadavvaibhav/machine-learning-linear-regression)
- [Distribution Plots using Seaborn](https://www.kaggle.com/iyadavvaibhav/data-viz-distribution-plots)

Or you may see all my Kernels [here](https://www.kaggle.com/iyadavvaibhav/kernels).


### Tableau Public

Data Visualization has been my passion since I started my journey in Data and Analytics. You can find some of the dashboards I created in Tableau below:

- [Whatsapp Chat Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/profile/iyadavvaibhav#!/vizhome/WhatsappChatAnalysis/Allsheets) - It shows chats by gender, time of the day and how chats grew over the month.
- [Personal Trip Expense Report](https://public.tableau.com/profile/iyadavvaibhav#!/vizhome/WeekendExpenseDB/DB) - It shows the expense by categories.
