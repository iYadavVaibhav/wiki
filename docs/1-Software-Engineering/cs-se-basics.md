# Software Engineering

*all about standards, conventions, ethics, practices*

## Best Practices

- Follow coding standards
- Use git
- Write Unit testing - use code to test the small units of programme, test standalone modules.
- Write integration testing - use code to test if modules work correclty when connected together.
- Do funcitonal testing - as a tester, test the functionality of the application.
- Test business outcomes, verify by business people
- Work with people smarter than you
- do pair programming

## Working on someone else's code

- Start a debugger
- Step into and over, understand the var values, add breakpoints.

## Coding Naming Conventions

- Python - Use underscores
- Javascript - Camel Case
- files and folders - use hyphen. Link [google style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/filenames#naming-guidelines)

## Computer Science

A thread is the smallest sequence of instructions that can be man‚Äê
aged independently. It is common for a process to have multiple
active threads, sometimes sharing resources such as memory or file
handles. Multithreaded web servers start a pool of threads and
select a thread from the pool to handle each incoming request.

### OOPS

- Object is a Class and has
  - `attributes` - variables
  - `methods()` - functions
